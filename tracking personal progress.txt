set my mind on a specific ps, inspired by a ray dalio vid
figured out what datasets i need
downloaded pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn and numpy libs
python environment was not compatible
reconfigured/installed python enviroment
got a dataset off Kaggle
saturated asf
got another from rbi official page
figured both data sets need to be from same place
so rbi it is
set up git repo (datasets, python test file and folder struct)
now figuring out how to move forward
downloaded openpyxl lib 
downloaded "notebook" lib and jupyter finally runs
made a new file into code folder named analysis.ipynb
made the first cell which checks libraries
figuring out jupyter and excel files and openpyxl to code
figured out/learnt how to write basic code snippets ot interact with data
dealing with gold excel file. loaded the data into python
few cells are a mess
(its 4am and i need to sleep)
fixed the count for extracting gold data
extracted gold data, formatting and storing left
made the gold dataframe, gold.xlsx not needed anymore
making clean gold data sheet is left, but first priority is constructing efficient basket for cpi (for dataframe 2)
variables decided for inflation
dataframe 2 complete
deciding how to manage multiple jupyter notebooks
merged all extraction in single notebook
also made a single new merged dataframe along with those two
made all the csv and excel files from dataframes
extraction officially complete!
